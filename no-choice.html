    <p>Tonight a met a man who has lived a very different life than I. After experiencing a heart attack at a weight of around 350 lbs, he realized that he would either change everything about his life style or die in 3 years. He was at risk of getting type II diabetes in his thirties and had begun to experience numbness in his legs.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, it wasn't all this guy's fault. Apparently, he was found to have have a basal metabolic rate (BMR) of only 1200 calories a day (the normal for an adult male is around 2400). His body naturally burned about half as many calories as a normal person, so even with a normal caloric intake, he would have to work out like a competitive athelete just to maintain his bodyweight.</p>
<p>With no choice, he began taking his life into his own hands. 7 days a week, he would get up at 5am and cycle, lift weights, and run for 4 hours. This was on top of working a job at IBM and raising 2 kids. </p>
<p>Despite being dealt the shittiest of hands, this guy created the determination to do what he had to do for himself and his family. In his case, fear was the motivator that allowed him to change his life. He admitted to me that absolutely hates lifting weights, but he still does it and has changed his life because of it.</p>
<p>Imagine what you could do if you took 4 hours of your day to work at something with life-or-death intensity. </p>
